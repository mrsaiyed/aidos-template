# Phase 5A: Full Game Pipeline — Self-Correcting Timestamp Refinement

## Goal
Clip every Lakers made shot across all 4 quarters of game 0052000121, producing
per-player highlight folders. Replace the formula-only Q1 timeline with a
self-correcting anchor chain that uses NBA API score signatures and the claude-video
watch skill to pin each play to the exact video second.

## Status
Steps 1–4 complete. Step 5 (end-to-end validation) in progress.

**Q1 agent-driven run complete (June 7, 2026):**
All 7 LAL scoring plays in Q1 confirmed via visual frame analysis using watch.py + NBA API score context.

| Play | Game Clock | Confirmed Video Time | Drift from Formula |
|------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Drummond dunk | Q1 11:10 | **82s** | 4s (formula: 78s) |
| LeBron tip layup | Q1 8:29 | **258s** | 94s (formula: 164s) |
| KCP 3PT (1st) | Q1 6:40 | **442s** | 94s (formula: 348s) |
| KCP 3PT (2nd) | Q1 4:43 | **687s** | 187s (formula: 500s) |
| Caruso 3PT | Q1 4:13 | **752s** | 192s (formula: 547s) |
| Caruso layup | Q1 2:49 | **947s** | 217s (formula: 730s) |
| AD floater | Q1 0:55 | **1176s** | 483s (formula: 693s) |

All 7 clips generated to `backend/data/outputs/0052000121/Q1_clips/` at 8s each (7s pre-roll, 1s post-roll).
Q2–Q4 runs pending.

## Background: Why This Phase Exists

The formula-based timeline (Phase 3) works within the first ~2 minutes of Q1.
Dead-ball time (timeouts, free throws, replays) accumulates across a quarter and
causes severe drift:

| Play | Formula estimate | Watch-confirmed actual | Drift |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Drummond dunk (early Q1) | 78s | 82s | ~4s — acceptable |
| KCP 3PT (mid Q1) | 348s | 442s | ~94s — wrong |
| Davis floater (late Q1) | 693s | 1177s | ~484s — completely wrong |

Manual quarter calibration is also impractical — it requires measuring every game
individually and breaks at different broadcast lengths.

The watch test (3 clips, June 2026) proved that NBA API score context + narrow
watch windows + scoreboard frame reading produces exact timestamps reliably.
This phase automates that pattern for the full game.

## Key Insight: Self-Correcting Anchor Chain

The NBA API delivers every play in chronological order with a unique score
signature (score_before, score_after). Each confirmed video timestamp becomes
the anchor for finding the next play. Drift is reset at every confirmation.
Quarter boundaries are implicit — the play sequence crosses them naturally
with a wider search window to absorb the inter-quarter break.

No manual Q2/Q3/Q4 start timestamps needed.

## Algorithm: Sequential Anchor Chain

Two anchor values are tracked at all times:
- `anchor_second` — the running position (updated on every play, confirmed or interpolated)
- `last_confirmed_second` / `last_confirmed_clock` — the most recent **watch-confirmed** timestamp

This separation is the key to surviving NOT_FOUND without cascading failure.

```
anchor_second          = Q1_TIP_OFF_SECOND   # 28.0 — known video start
last_confirmed_second  = Q1_TIP_OFF_SECOND
last_confirmed_clock   = 720.0               # 12:00 Q1 in seconds remaining
degraded               = False               # True after a NOT_FOUND
last_period            = 1

for play in all_lal_made_shots_in_chronological_order:

    # --- Compute search window ---
    if play.period != last_period:
        # Quarter boundary: wide window, search well ahead of last anchor
        search_start = anchor_second + 60
        search_end   = anchor_second + QUARTER_BREAK_SEARCH_SECONDS
        degraded     = False   # fresh period resets degraded flag
    elif degraded:
        # Previous play was NOT_FOUND — expand window to compensate
        window = REFINEMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS * DEGRADED_WINDOW_MULTIPLIER  # × 3
        search_start = max(0, anchor_second - window)
        search_end   = anchor_second + window
    else:
        search_start = max(0, anchor_second - 15)
        search_end   = anchor_second + REFINEMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS

    context = {
        "player": play.player_name,
        "play_type": play.event_subtype,
        "description": play.description,
        "score_before": play.score_before,
        "score_after": play.score_after,
        "period": play.period,
        "clock": play.game_clock,
    }

    found_second = run_watch_scan(video, search_start, search_end, context)

    if found_second is None:
        # One retry at 2× the already-expanded window
        found_second = run_watch_scan(
            video,
            search_start - REFINEMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS,
            search_end   + REFINEMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS,
            context
        )

    if found_second is not None:
        # --- CONFIRMED ---
        play.video_time_seconds   = found_second
        play.refinement_method    = "watch_confirmed"
        play.status               = "refined"
        anchor_second             = found_second
        last_confirmed_second     = found_second
        last_confirmed_clock      = parse_game_clock(play.game_clock)
        degraded                  = False

    else:
        # --- NOT_FOUND: interpolate from the last confirmed anchor ---
        #
        # We know the exact game-clock gap between the last confirmed play
        # and this play. We scale it by DEAD_BALL_RATIO to convert game
        # time to real broadcast time. This keeps the interpolated anchor
        # in the right neighbourhood even after several misses.
        #
        # DEAD_BALL_RATIO = 1.6 (derived from Q1 test data:
        #   1149s broadcast / 720s game time = 1.596, rounded to 1.6)
        #
        game_clock_elapsed = last_confirmed_clock - parse_game_clock(play.game_clock)
        estimated_video_elapsed = game_clock_elapsed * DEAD_BALL_RATIO
        interpolated_second = last_confirmed_second + estimated_video_elapsed

        play.video_time_seconds   = interpolated_second
        play.refinement_method    = "interpolated"
        play.status               = "unconfirmed"
        anchor_second             = interpolated_second
        degraded                  = True  # expand window for next play

    last_period = play.period
```

### Why this survives the failure mode

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 NOT_FOUND in a row | anchor advances by clock-scaled estimate; next search window is 3× wider |
| 2 NOT_FOUND in a row | both interpolated from the same last-confirmed anchor; each uses its own clock gap — errors do not compound |
| 3+ NOT_FOUND in a row | same as above; interpolation quality degrades but next confirmed play resets everything |
| Quarter break | `degraded` flag cleared; wide QUARTER_BREAK_SEARCH_SECONDS window used regardless |

The critical rule: **the next play's window is never derived from an interpolated anchor alone** — it is always derived from `last_confirmed_second` + the NBA API clock gap × DEAD_BALL_RATIO. Interpolated positions do not accumulate error into each other.

## Score Change Detection (how frames are read)

For each watch scan the script produces ~60 JPEG frames with absolute timestamps.
The search reads frames looking for the scoreboard scorebug to change from
score_before to score_after. The first frame where score_after appears on screen
is the confirmed video second.

Score signature format from NBA API:
- score_before: "LAL 4 GSW 15" (from scoreHome/scoreAway on previous event)
- score_after: "LAL 7 GSW 15" (from scoreHome/scoreAway on this event)

The uniqueness of each score state (no two consecutive plays produce the same
score) makes false positives essentially impossible within a 60-90 second window.

## Decisions Made
- Self-correcting anchor chain replaces manual quarter timestamp calibration
- Q2/Q3/Q4 start times are implicit — no longer required on Game model
- TimelineService formula retained as fallback for very first play only
- watch.py called via subprocess (same as existing test_watch_video.py pattern)
- REFINEMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS = 45 (tight window after each anchor)
- QUARTER_BREAK_SEARCH_SECONDS = 300 (broadcast quarter breaks are 3-5 minutes. 300s window is sufficient and cheaper than 600s.)
- DEGRADED_WINDOW_MULTIPLIER = 3 (window expands to 3× after any NOT_FOUND)
- DEAD_BALL_RATIO = 1.6 (derived from Q1 test data: 1149s broadcast / 720s game time = 1.596, rounded to 1.6. This is a Q1 approximation — Q4 in close games may be higher due to more timeouts and free throws.)
- Two anchors tracked: `anchor_second` (running position) and `last_confirmed_second` (last watch-confirmed); interpolation always derives from `last_confirmed_second` so errors do not compound across consecutive NOT_FOUND plays
- NOT_FOUND plays use interpolated fallback and mark status="unconfirmed"; `degraded=True` expands the next play's search window automatically
- MAX_CLIPS_PER_PLAYER raised to 20 for full-game reels
- Q1_END_SECONDS hard cap removed entirely
- refinement_method stored on Moment: "watch_confirmed" | "interpolated" | "formula"
- Automated sync method: watch.py runs as subprocess for each play in the anchor chain. Identical to the proven 3-clip manual test. NBA API score context passed as prompt. FOUND: <seconds> parsed from output. No separate frame reader needed. No OCR. No Vision API called directly. Proven approach only.
- score_before/score_after stored as String on Moment (e.g. "LAL 4 GSW 15")
